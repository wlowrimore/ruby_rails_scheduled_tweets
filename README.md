This application is my first steps into learning and utilizing Ruby on Rails.  This tutorial comes from <a href="gorails.com">gorails.com, and is taught by <a href="https://excid3.com/">Chris Oliver</a>.<br>

I highly recommend this tutorial!  Chris is an incredible teacher that makes the information make sense!<br><br>

<i>"GoRails was started as a way to learn web development and the problem solving strategies behind it. We want to provide a fresh approach to learning by showing our learning, problem solving, design, and development processes.

Traditional learning materials give you a structured approach to a solution. We know that problems rarely fit this structure and that any problem can be solved by approaching it the right way.

Chris knows this struggle first hand. As a self-taught engineer, he is familiar with the challenges of becoming a developer."</i> - <a href="gorails.com/about">Go Rails</a><br><br>  

This app is a work in progress, and this README.md will be updated as progress is being made.<br><br>
